## The Quest System



Every server offers **5 daily quests**. But here's the twist - each quest throws a random challenge at you:



**Word Scramble** - Unscramble the word before time runs out

**Math Challenge** - Solve equations under pressure

**Trivia** - Test your knowledge

**Reaction Test** - Click when it turns green

**Memory Game** - Remember the emoji sequence



Choose from **Easy, Medium, or Hard** difficulty. Higher risk = higher rewards.



Success? Earn **Dakari** currency and **Gems**.

Failure? That quest is locked until tomorrow.



**Commands:**

`/quests` - View available quests

`/tutorial` - Learn how to play
