The Quest System
```

Every server offers **5 daily quests**. But here's the twist - each quest throws a random challenge at you:

**Word Scramble** - Unscramble the word before time runs out
**Math Challenge** - Solve equations under pressure
**Trivia** - Test your knowledge
**Reaction Test** - Click when it turns green
**Memory Game** - Remember the sequence

Choose from **Easy, Medium, or Hard** difficulty. Higher risk = higher rewards.

Success? Earn **Dakari** currency and **Gems**.
Failure? That quest is locked until tomorrow.

**Commands:**
`/quests` - View available quests | `/tutorial` - Learn how to play
